# Installation Guide for ScrollNt


## Introduction
ScrollNt is a browser extension that enhances your browsing experience by distracting you from watching YouTube too much by having a tab pop up whenever it detects that you are. This guide will help you download and install it.

## Downloading the Extension
1. Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FracturedToenail/ScrollNt) of ScrollNt.
2. Navigate to the 'Releases' section on the repository page (same as the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FracturedToenail/ScrollNt)).
3. Locate the latest release and download the appropriate file labelled `ScrollNt Unpacked`.
4. Navigate to wherever your browser saved that file. (On MacOS the default location is at `~/Downloads`, on Windows it is at `C:\users\[your username]\downloads`.)
4. Decompress/unzip/extract `ScrollNt Unpacked.zip`.

## Installing the Extension in Chrome and [Chromium based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser) such as Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, etc)
1. Open the browser and enter the URL `chrome://extensions/`. into your search bar. On browsers other than Google Chrome this may be something else, or this may redirect to some other internal page;
2. Enable 'Developer mode' by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
3. Click on 'Load unpacked' and select the `ScrollNt Unzipped` folder of the downloaded extension.
    1. From testing, on Windows 10 there is an issue where you have to navigate into the `ScrollNt Unpacked` folder *twice*, the the second time *inside* the first folder. This seems to be an issue with MacOS hidden folders. This may also arise on GNU/Linux or other operating systems.
4. The extension should now appear in your extensions list and be ready to use.
5. You may now delete the unzipped and zipped files of the extension, even the ones that you used to load the extension. 

## Installing the Extension in Firefox 
1. Open Firefox and go to `about:addons`.
2. Click on the gear icon and select 'Install Add-on From File'.
3. Choose the downloaded file and follow the prompts to install.
4. You may now delete the unzipped and zipped files of the extension.

## Installing on other browsers
For this, refer to the documentation of said browser.

## Post-Installation Steps
- After installation, you might need to configure the extension by clicking on the extension icon (a white outline of a timer and a YouTube icon over a red square)

## Troubleshooting (in no particular order)
- Reinstall the extension
- Update your browser
- If you don't know what to do, look at the manual. It will soon avaliable on the wiki of the GitHub, and in the extension itself by clicking on the icon and selecting "Manual"
